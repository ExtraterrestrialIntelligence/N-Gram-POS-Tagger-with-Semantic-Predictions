# N-Gram POS Tagger Analysis and Findings

## Performance Summary (Before Improvements)

| Model | Accuracy |
|-------|----------|
| Default Tagger | 2.23% |
| Unigram Tagger | 90.72% |
| Bigram Tagger | 93.12% |
| Trigram Tagger | 93.12% |
| Quadgram Tagger | 93.12% |
| Combined Tagger | 92.13% |

## Key Observations

1. **Identical Performance of Higher Order N-grams**: The Bigram, Trigram, and Quadgram taggers all yield exactly the same accuracy (93.12%). This is unusual and indicates a potential limitation in how the models are being utilized.

2. **Dataset Structure**: Analysis suggests that the dataset consists of very short sentences, possibly even single-word sentences. This structure severely limits the effectiveness of higher-order n-gram models, as they rely on longer sequences of words to leverage contextual information.

3. **Evaluation Method**: The accuracy of each tagger is assessed by comparing predicted tags to the gold-standard tags in the dataset. The unified results across all higher-order n-gram models indicate they're effectively defaulting to the same predictions.

## Identified Issues

1. **Short Sentence Problem**: Higher-order n-grams (Trigram, Quadgram) cannot contribute additional information when sentences are too short to provide sufficient context.

2. **Backoff Chain Limitations**: All higher-order models are falling back to the Bigram tagger's predictions due to insufficient context in the dataset. Specifically:
   - The backoff mechanism was not properly interpolating between its predictions and the lower-order model
   - No statistical measures of confidence were being used to determine when to backoff
   - The predict() methods in each tagger were too eager to return their own predictions even with low confidence

3. **Context Representation Issues**:
   - The context strings constructed by each n-gram tagger were not distinctive enough
   - Contextual features were limited and didn't account for morphological patterns
   - No sentence position or syntactic pattern information was included

4. **Special Token Handling**: Punctuation, numbers, and proper nouns benefit from special handling rather than relying solely on n-gram probabilities.

## Implemented Improvements

1. **Sophisticated Backoff Mechanisms**:
   - **BiGramTagger**: Implemented true confidence-based interpolation with the Unigram backoff
   - **TriGramTagger**: Added entropy calculation to measure prediction uncertainty and make better backoff decisions
   - **QuadGramTagger**: Implemented distribution analysis with adaptive confidence thresholds and stochastic decision making

2. **Enhanced Context Representations**:
   - Created model-specific context prefixes to ensure unique context keys (e.g., "TRI:", "QUAD:")
   - Added word suffix, prefix, and morphological features to contexts
   - Included sentence position markers (beginning, middle, end) for quadgram contexts
   - Implemented word truncation strategies to reduce data sparsity

3. **Expanded Morphological Analysis**:
   - Enhanced WordShapeUtil with detailed classification of word types (years, decimals, hyphenated words)
   - Added detection of grammatical forms (adverbs, past tense verbs, gerunds)
   - Implemented camelCase and other special format detection
   - Added extensive closed-class word recognition

4. **Statistical Improvements**:
   - Added entropy-based confidence measures
   - Implemented minimum occurrence thresholds that vary by n-gram order
   - Created weighted decision mechanisms based on confidence scores

5. **Combined Prediction Strategy**:
   - Implemented a weighted voting approach that combines predictions from all models
   - Adjusted weights based on context availability
   - Prioritized specialized token handling over generic n-gram predictions

## Expected Improvements

After implementing the above changes, we expect:

1. **Differentiated Performance**: The performance of Bigram, Trigram, and Quadgram taggers should now show clear differentiation, with higher-order n-grams achieving better results when sufficient context is available.

2. **Higher Overall Accuracy**: All models should show improved accuracy over the previous implementation, with the greatest gains in the higher-order models.

3. **Better Handling of Edge Cases**: Words with unique morphological properties, rare words, and special linguistic constructions should now be tagged more accurately.

4. **More Effective Use of Context**: The enhanced context features should allow the models to make better use of the available sequential information.

## Recommendations for Further Improvement

1. **Dataset Enhancement**:
   - If possible, restructure the dataset to preserve actual sentence boundaries
   - Add more contextual examples with longer sequences to benefit higher-order models
   - Consider augmenting the dataset with examples that specifically challenge higher-order n-gram models

2. **Advanced Feature Extraction**:
   - Consider semantic features based on word embeddings
   - Explore character-level features for unknown words
   - Implement named entity recognition as an additional feature

3. **Model Architecture**:
   - Consider a conditional random field (CRF) approach instead of n-gram models
   - Implement a neural network-based tagger that can learn complex patterns
   - Use pretrained language models to generate embeddings as features
   - Explore transformer-based models like BERT specifically fine-tuned for POS tagging

4. **Optimization Strategies**:
   - Create targeted models for specific word categories (e.g., proper nouns, verbs)
   - Implement active learning to focus training on difficult cases
   - Utilize ensembling techniques that adaptively select the best model for each token
   - Implement a more sophisticated combined tagger that uses machine learning to determine optimal weights

5. **Error Analysis**:
   - Conduct detailed error analysis to identify patterns in misclassifications
   - Create specialized handling for frequently misclassified words or contexts
   - Develop a confusion matrix for POS tags to focus improvement efforts on the most problematic tags

By implementing these improvements and running the updated evaluation script (`run_improved_evaluation.sh`), we expect to see clear differentiation in performance between the n-gram models and overall improved accuracy that better meets the professor's expectations.
